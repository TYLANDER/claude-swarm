Run the test suite and analyze results.

Execute: `npm run test`

After running:
1. Report total tests passed/failed
2. If failures exist, analyze the error messages
3. Suggest fixes for failing tests
4. Check test coverage if available: `npm run test -- --coverage`

If tests fail, offer to fix them.
